<h1>Holi</h1>
<p>Holi is considered as one of the most revered and celebrated festivals of India and it is
celebrated in almost every part of the country. It is also sometimes called asthe “festival of love”
as on this day people get to unite together forgetting all resentments and all types of bad feeling
towards each other. The great Indian festival lasts for a day and a night, which starts in the
evening of Purnima or the Full Moon Day in the month of Falgun. It is celebrated with the name
Holika Dahan or Choti Holi on first evening of the festival and the following day is called Holi.
